Recovery of gold from ore
Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Digital. The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises.

The model must predict the recovery rate of gold from gold ore. Use data with mining and purification parameters.

The model will help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.

You need:

Prepare data;
Conduct exploratory data analysis;
Build and train the model.
To complete the project, use the pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn libraries. Their documentation will help you.
